# Adopt a Cat Website

This is a website which aims to promote the adoption of cats from a small shelter based in Southampton.
(This is a fictive organisation.)

It was created using HTML and CSS with Flexbox Grids.
It is a responsive website.
The Contact and Newsletter form does not work for the moment.

Font Awesome came handy with the icons and all of the photos used are from Unsplash.com or they have CC0.
